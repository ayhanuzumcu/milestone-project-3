## UX

### Strategy
My aim for the website design was in the easiest way possible to login, to add, edit, delete and search recipes while trying to make a website for user-friendly page.

### Scope
For cooking lovers and users, I wanted to provide them to see, search recipes and add, edit, delete recipes to create their recipe inventory.

### Structure
For all users, they can search and see all recipes even if they do not add them. And also they can add their own recipes and store them on website to check later or to edit or delete them. The website is easy to use as users can navigate all around the site using navbar.

### Surface

The orange color was used to design the page.

### Technology

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Materialize (1.0.0)
4. Python 3
5. MongoDB Atlas
6. PostgreSQL


### Database Schema
![Database Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayhanuzumcu/milestone-project-3/main/recipes/images/db_schema.jpg "Database Schema")

Database divided into three sections: Cuisine, users and recipes. Postgresql database was used for "cuisine" and "users" tables and MongoDB database was used for the "recipes" collection. There is a relationship on "cuisine_name" data between these databases.



### Features
This website was designed for several pages. For first time users, they can find register section on the main page. After registration, Recipe list is shown and the user can also access New Recipe and My Recipe section. Under My Recipe page, the user can edit and delete their own recipe. Every delete button on every recipe card has a defensive programming modal built. When the user wants to delete a recipe, a modal pop up appears and asking the user to confirm if they want to delete or not. The admin can only add, edit and delete cuisines to the website. When admin deletes a cuisine, any recipe under this cuisine will delete automatically because of the relation in the databases between cuisine and recipes. The site was build for mobile friendly using Materialize features. 


### Testing

#### W3C Validation 

HMTL and CSS codes were tested on W3C Validation Service and both tests were passed but there is an error related to Materialize CSS file on CSS results.

You can find the links to the test results here:

[HTML Test Result Link](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Frecipes-m.herokuapp.com%2F)

[CSS Test Result Link](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Frecipes-m.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

You can find the screenshoots here:

[CSS Test Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayhanuzumcu/milestone-project-3/main/recipes/images/CSS.jpg)

During the self-testing, I have added a defensive programming then users can not delete recepies accidentally.

Also just admin can add, edit and delete cuisines. 

#### Bugs/Fixes

**Images on the recipe and my recipe pages**

**Issue**: I had an issue with the quality of the images as they appeared stretched.
* **FIX**: I added an outer div before the picture frame div. And I added outer class for the outer div and frame class for the picture frame div and I added height to 300px and width to 250px for the outer div in the css file.
